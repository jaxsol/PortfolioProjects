This insight will be used to provide high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n","\n","## Data cleaning techniques and tools used\n","CSV files used for data analysis were cleaned by filtering, sorting, removing duplicates, and using data validation to ensure consistency in ActivityDate column in dailyActivity_merged.csv and SleepDay column in sleepDay_merged.csv.\n","\n","Some issues with the data include Ids that do not have data for entire 30 day tracking period in the dailyActivity_merged.csv and 24 out of 30 participants tracked in the sleepDay_merged.csv with some of the 24 participants not having data for entire 30 day tracking period.  \n","\n","## Upload CSV files to R\n","FitBit Fitness Tracker Data Source: <https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit>\n","\n","This Public Domain Kaggle dataset made available through Mobius contains personal fitness tracker information from thirty eligible Fitbit users that consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
